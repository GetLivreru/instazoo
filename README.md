# Full-Stack Java Spring Project

## Description

This project represents the backend part of a Full-Stack web application developed using Java Spring and MySQL. The application provides a REST API for interaction with the client side and includes user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token). The project is focused on creating a scalable and secure web application using modern development practices.

## Features

- **REST API Creation**: Various endpoints are implemented for client interaction.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Token.
- **MySQL Database Integration**: Data management using the MySQL relational database.
- **Data Validation**: Validation of objects on the server side (Java) and, if implemented, on the client side.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error classes and approaches for handling errors are implemented.
- **Custom Annotations**: Utilization of custom annotations to simplify and enhance the code.
- **Debugging**: Methods for finding and fixing bugs and errors.
- **Postman Testing**: API endpoints were tested using Postman to ensure proper functionality and response handling.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Security**: Spring Security, JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Validation**: Hibernate Validator
- **Testing**: Postman

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <URL of your repository>
    ```

2. **Database setup**:
    - Ensure that MySQL is installed and running.

    - Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
    - Run the application via the `main` class.

4. **Access the API**:
    - After the application is running, the API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api/`.

5. **Testing with Postman**:
    - Use Postman to send requests to the API endpoints.
    - Ensure that the responses are as expected and that the API behaves correctly.
